## Hello, world!

Iâ€™m the James B. Duke Assistant Professor of the Practice in Data Science at Davidson College. 
I accepted an appointment to the Davidson faculty in 2024 after working for over a decade 
as a developer, consultant, and team leader in the private sector and higher education.

The focus of my teaching is on practical data skills. I'm not a scholar, and don't 
pretend to be one. I'm just an average guy who loves building cool stuff with data.

And this is my home on the internet, where I keep my [bio](bio.qmd) and [CV](cv.qmd), a list of the
[courses](courses.qmd) I teach, and some of the [projects](projects/projects.qmd) I have worked on.
