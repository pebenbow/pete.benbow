:::{#hero-heading}

I was added as co-author on this package in 2026 after coding several "quality of life" enhancements. It provides a wrapper for evaluating unit tests in R with the `testthat` package, and producing output that can be used with certain autograder software. For example, I rely on Gradescope for my courses, and `gradeR` has a function specifically for producing JSON output that is compatible with Gradescope's autograder.
