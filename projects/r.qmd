### Cat Scheduler Dashboard

![](images/catsched.png){width="800"}

This is an interactive dashboard I built in **R Shiny** for department chairs and Academic Affairs staff at Davidson 
to visualize the _planned_ course schedule for upcoming academic years. Professors have an application 
they can access (called "Cat Scheduler", abbreviated as "CatSched") where they submit their day, time, and location preferences 
for the courses they're going to teach, as well as equipment, layout, and other classroom features. 

After they submit these preferences, the Cat Scheduler algorithm (developed by my colleague Dr. Laurie Heyer) 
tries to build an optimal course schedule for the entire college based on the availability of classrooms and 
the preferences of the faculty. After this schedule is built, my dashboard visualizes the results so the 
faculty (particularly the department chairs) can make adjustments, specifically so they can try to distribute
their classes somewhat evenly throughout a given week in the hopes of spreading out the demand for shared 
college spaces and resources.

Users can select the semester they want to review, as well as the "department group," which helps group together 
courses from different disciplines according to some logic from the Registrar's office that I never fully 
understood, but I think has to do with them often sharing the same buildings. But I could be wrong.

The data comes from the CatSched API, a REST interface that sits on top of MongoDB. It refreshes automatically 
when a user loads the dashboard, but I also included the "REFRESH DEPARTMENTS" button in the upper-right corner 
in case someone wants to query fresh data from the API while they're reviewing a particular department group.

Another cool aspect of this is the embedded user guide, which gives users a quick walkthrough of how to navigate 
the dashboard.
