## Custom PC (2025)

![](images/custom-pc2025.jpg){style="float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 10px;" width="300"}

My latest creation did away with all the RGB lighting that my previous build had, instead going for a more discreet aesthetic. To get there, I used a Fractal Design North case with the same RTX 3070 GPU from my previous build, as well as the same storage configuration, but a brand new motherboard, CPU, PSU, 64GB RAM, and an AIO cooler. This thing runs like a dream, and I love the way this thing looks, especially how the walnut accents on the front of the case coordinate with my Ikea desk top and my Edifier speakers.

## Custom PC (2020)

This was the first custom PC I ever built myself. I ordered the parts for this 
in March 2020, literally one week before the whole world went on lockdown due
to COVID-19. If I had waited any longer, I might have never gotten these
components because suddenly everybody decided to use the pandemic as an excuse to 
get into gaming, plus the crypto-bros started to buy up all the GPUs, leading
to worldwide scarcity and price-gouging. Those were weird days...

I did a fair amount of gaming on this, but I also used it as my video editing/production 
station when I was recording all the content for my Power BI and SQL courses on edX. 
It served me really well until 2025 when it got replaced by my newest rig.

for graphics, but I upgraded to the RTX 3070 in 2022.
