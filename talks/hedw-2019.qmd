### Abstract

Deploying changes to your data warehouse can be an elaborate, hands-on affair. Everything from work item tracking to code review, merges, builds, deployments, and documentation can take days to orchestrate across a plethora of systems. In this session, we’ll show you how Davidson College uses Azure DevOps as its one-stop shop for all these functions, creating a streamlined and automated lifecycle for our Enterprise Data Warehouse that saves valuable hours of productivity and allows us to iterate very rapidly across the database, ETL, and semantic layers.
