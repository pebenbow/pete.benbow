### About Me

![](images/justpete.jpg){fig-alt="Pete Benbow" style="float:right;padding: 0 0 0 10px;" height="250"}

Well, as mentioned on the Home page, I'm a professor of the practice[^1] in Data Science at Davidson
College, where I also earned my degree. I took a meandering path to get here. My
twenties featured notable career accolades like being a law school dropout, 
losing my job and living on unemployment for several months during the Great Recession,
and even two painful, sleep-deprived stints at the United States Marine Corps 
Officer Candidates School (OCS)[^2] in Quantico, Virginia. I used to
think I was cursed, until one day I ended up in a corporate job that I thought
would go nowhere, but ended up changing my life forever.

That job introduced me to working with data, specifically through programming and
data visualization. And from that point on, I was hooked. And it turns out I was
pretty good at it, too, because they promoted me pretty rapidly, to the point where
I went from a junior analyst to a manager to a director all in the space of less 
than four years.

But then I got really tired of the corporate world and took a job at Davidson
as a developer in the IT department. It was a welcome change of pace after being
in management, and it gave me opportunities I never would have gotten in the private
sector. In particular, it eventually led me to my dream job, the one I have now,
teaching data science at my alma mater.

### Fly-fishing

I picked up the art of fly-fishing from my dad in my senior year of college.
So far, I have fly-fished all over North Carolina, parts of Tennessee and Virginia, 
as well as Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and Washington. I tried to fish on
Isle of Skye, Scotland, but a huge storm blew through and I had to cancel the trip
because it is literally impossible to cast a fly rod when you're facing 50mpg wind gusts.

I'm probably an average angler at best. I go a few times a year, which is not nearly
enough to satisfy my love of the sport, but it's incredibly restorative when I find 
time for it. The solitude of being in the Appalachians and communing with nature 
is a spiritual experience for me, even if I don't catch a single fish.

### Skiing


Downhill skiing is my wife's passion, and she used to work as a ski instructor when
she lived in Colorado. She re-introduced me to the sport after we got married, and
since then we've skied mostly in Banff and Steamboat Springs. At
some point, she says she'll take me to Park City and Big Sky, which are probably
her two favorite places to hit the powder.

I love to ski, but I'm not terribly good at it. 
I pretty much just stick to the blue runs when we go out west.

## Travels

My wife and I are homebodies most of the time, no doubt about it, but occasionally
we love to travel. As a student, I had the good fortune to study overseas at the
University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, where I focused on political 
philosophy and literature. In my senior year, I also got to participate in an 
awesome political science research trip to Colombia. Both of these experiences
gave me the travel bug, so we try to do a big international trip every few years
if we can.

[^1]: If you're not familiar with the term, "professors of the practice" are faculty
who are appointed to teach based on their professional experience rather 
than any scholarly achievements, which describes me perfectly because
I have no scholarly achievements. üòÅ

[^2]: One of the coolest experiences I ever had, minus the part where they shaved
my head, and minus the part where I got injured during training and they had to 
drop me from the program. If you're curious what Marine Corps OCS is like,
