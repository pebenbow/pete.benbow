### About Me

![](images/justpete.jpg){fig-alt="Pete Benbow" style="float:right;padding: 0 0 0 10px;" height="250"}

Well, as mentioned on the Home page, I'm a professor of the practice in Data Science at Davidson
College, where I also earned my degree. If you're not familiar with the term, 
"professors of the practice" are faculty who are appointed to teach based on their 
professional experience rather than any scholarly achievements, which describes 
me perfectly because I have no scholarly achievements. üòÅ

I took a meandering path to get here. My twenties featured notable career accolades 
like dropping out of law school, losing my job during the Great Recession and living 
unemployed with my parents for several months, and doing a couple of stints at the 
United States Marine Corps Officer Candidates School (OCS) in Quantico, Virginia. 
In short, I am well-acquainted with navigating personal and professional uncertainty. 

Eventually my career stabilized, and I spent the better part of a decade working my way up the ladder
in the private sector. I quickly moved from being a junior data analyst to a manager, 
then a director, all in the span of less than four years. But then I got really tired 
of managing people and all their drama, so I took a demotion and left my director 
job to come work at Davidson as a senior developer in the college's IT department. 
It was a welcome change of pace from the corporate world, and it eventually led 
me to my dream job, the one I have now, teaching data science at my alma mater.

### Fly-fishing

I picked up the art of fly-fishing from my dad in my senior year of college.
So far, I have fly-fished all over North Carolina, parts of Tennessee and Virginia, 
as well as Michigan, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and Washington.

I'm an average angler at best. I go a few times a year, which is not nearly
enough to satisfy my love of the sport, but it's incredibly restorative when I find 
time for it. The solitude of being in the Appalachians and communing with nature 
is a spiritual experience for me, even if I don't catch a single fish.

## Travels

My wife and I are homebodies most of the time, but occasionally we love to travel. 
As a student, I had the good fortune to study overseas at the University of Cambridge 
in the United Kingdom, where I focused on political philosophy and literature. 
In my senior year, I also got to participate in an awesome political science research 
trip to Colombia. Both of these experiences gave me the travel bug, so we try to 
do a big international trip once every few years if we can.
