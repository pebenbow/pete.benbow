    "text": "Assignment calendar with highcharter\n\nAs part of the custom websites I build for each of my courses, I have a calendar visual that displays the start date and due date for each assignment in the class. I wanted to give my students an easy reference for when assignments are going to come due, and I was inspired by the common Gantt chart visual. Every day of the semester is represented on the X axis, and the Y axis is grouped by assignment types (quizzes, labs, homeworks).\nTo create this, I used the highcharter package, which supports greater interactivity than your standard base R and ggplot visuals.\nBeyond the basic visual, I added a couple of elements I thought would be helpful:\n\nA vertical red line indicating the current day.\nA semi-transparent tooltip that appears when the student hovers over a specific assignment, displaying the release date and due date.\n\nThe only thing I don’t like about this is how the numeric representation of each assignment’s release date and due date is included in the tooltip on the very top line (where you can see “17581536000000 - 17591904000000”). But as long as you don’t pay attention to that, I think this is a great resource for my students.\nHere’s the R code (click to expand):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCat Scheduler Dashboard\n\nThis is an interactive dashboard I built in R Shiny for department chairs and Academic Affairs staff at Davidson to visualize the planned course schedule for upcoming academic years. Professors have an application they can access (called “Cat Scheduler”, abbreviated as “CatSched”) where they submit their day, time, and location preferences for the courses they’re going to teach, as well as equipment, layout, and other classroom features.\nAfter they submit these preferences, the Cat Scheduler algorithm (developed by my colleague Dr. Laurie Heyer) tries to build an optimal course schedule for the entire college based on the availability of classrooms and the preferences of the faculty. After this schedule is built, my dashboard visualizes the results so the faculty (particularly the department chairs) can make adjustments, specifically so they can try to distribute their classes somewhat evenly throughout a given week in the hopes of spreading out the demand for shared college spaces and resources.\nUsers can select the semester they want to review, as well as the “department group,” which helps group together courses from different disciplines according to some logic from the Registrar’s office that I never fully understood, but I think has to do with them often sharing the same buildings. But I could be wrong.\nThe data comes from the CatSched API, a REST interface that sits on top of MongoDB. It refreshes automatically when a user loads the dashboard, but I also included the “REFRESH DEPARTMENTS” button in the upper-right corner in case someone wants to query fresh data from the API while they’re reviewing a particular department group.\nAnother cool aspect of this is the embedded user guide, which gives users a quick walkthrough of how to navigate the dashboard.\nLink to source code in GitHub",

    "text": "This is a sampling of some of the data viz work I’ve done in Microsoft Power BI.\n\nDavidson College Fact File\nInstitutional research teams at colleges and universities across the United States maintain institutional “fact files” or “fact books” that contain aggregated data about the schools. These data are carefully curated each year and scrutinized before the schools publish them because these are considered official publications that represent various facets of the institution, including enrollment, academics, faculty demographics, and so forth.\nA few years ago, I was tasked with revamping Davidson’s fact file into an interactive Power BI report, and this was the result.\n\n\n\n\nBasketball analytics\nI have horrible sports knowledge, but I love Davidson basketball. Anyone who has been to my office and seen the signed memorabilia on the wall from Davidson’s fairy-tale run to the Elite Eight in March 2008 knows the level of my commitment to Wildcat hoops. So it was really cool when my colleague Tim Chartier asked me to showcase Power BI’s capabilities with some shot data that was collected by the Cats Stats sports analytics group that he works with.\nThis is one of my older projects, but a favorite of mine because of the dark theme, the amount of interactivity to allow you to explore the data, and the chance I had to build unique visuals. I especially love the shot charts, which are just basic scatterplots with semi-transparent backgrounds laid on top of an image of an NCAA regulation basketball court, and the chord diagram, which does a fantastic job of showing the relationships between players as they pass to each other.",
