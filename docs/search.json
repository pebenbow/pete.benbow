    "text": "This is a sampling of some of the data viz work I’ve done in Microsoft Power BI.\n\nDavidson College Fact File\nInstitutional research teams at colleges and universities across the United States maintain institutional “fact files” or “fact books” that contain aggregated data about the schools. These data are carefully curated each year and scrutinized before the schools publish them because these are considered official publications that represent various facets of the institution, including enrollment, academics, faculty demographics, and so forth.\nA few years ago, I was tasked with revamping Davidson’s fact file into an interactive Power BI report, and this was the result.\n\n\n\n\nBasketball analytics\nI have horrible sports knowledge, but I love Davidson basketball. Anyone who has been to my office and seen the signed memorabilia on the wall from Davidson’s fairy-tale run to the Elite Eight in March 2008 knows the level of my commitment to Wildcat hoops. So it was really cool when my colleague Tim Chartier asked me to showcase Power BI’s capabilities with some shot data that was collected by the Cats Stats sports analytics group that he works with.\nThis is one of my older projects, but a favorite of mine because of the dark theme, the amount of interactivity to allow you to explore the data, and the chance I had to build unique visuals. I especially love the shot charts, which are just basic scatterplots with semi-transparent backgrounds laid on top of an image of an NCAA regulation basketball court, and the chord diagram, which does a fantastic job of showing the relationships between players as they pass to each other.",
